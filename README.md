# Earthquake-Visualization
The project idea is to use Earthquake data to display earthquakes on a map. The application uses the latitude and longitude information from each earthquake and scales it to the map so that an earthquake can be drawn on the map at the place of occurrence. The magnitude is repesented using different shade of red.
